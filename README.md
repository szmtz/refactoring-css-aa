Refactoring CSS Practice - a/A

In this practice, you will be refactoring CSS written by another developer to meet new requirements. This is a common task on the job. Designs change, themes get refreshed, or a design ends up just not looking quite right.

Your main focus is to practice changing someone else's code while you familiarize yourself with the vast typography, sizing, text styling and use of background images that CSS has to offer.

Once you have downloaded the starter, open the index.html file in your browser. Then, navigate to the main.css file and start refactoring the code to meet the new requirements.

Don't forget to save and refresh your page to see the changes!
